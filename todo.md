# TODOs ðŸ“”
- 
- [ ] switch to real part last in dataset
- [ ] I made a change to AdaLN unsqueeze(1) -> unsqueeze(0) - ok??
- [ ] re-add workspace normalization
- [ ] data augmentation
  - [ ] world frame rotation/translation
- [ ] CLIP/Dino feature analysis
  - [ ] plot cosine distance vs. camera angle of same feature
- [ ] steps to full RGB + affordance mask
  - [ ] take only features from a sphere around keypoints
    - [x] equip open drawer w/ meaningful keypoints
- [ ] Install correct torchvision version according to https://pypi.org/project/torchvision/
  - error message: ```/home/felix/miniforge3/envs/robodiff/lib/python3.9/site-packages/torchvision/io/image.py:13: UserWarning: Failed to load image Python extension: libtorch_cuda_cu.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory```
- [ ] fix KILL event in env_runner (due to oom)
  - [ ] convert data to zarr and load via replay buffer
- [x] check encoder from 3D diffusion policy
- [x] maybe add visualization where gripper should be
- [x] try out self attention for feature pcd encoding/decoding
- [x] add bce error for open gripper
- [x] generate keypoint dataset + clean dataset
  - [ ] rename {task}_keypoint to {task}
- [x] cleanup flow matching policy
- [x] check why workspace cropping + refill throws error (what happens if ws is zero?)
- [x] fix data augmentation
- [x]  check why multirun crashed
    - probably because Pyrep is killed and started again
    - cant do multiruns I guess 
- [x] Write a batch script that launches jobs
- [x] cull pcd based on workspace size 
  - [x] leads to unequal shapes, refill deltas
